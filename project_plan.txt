PROGRAM OVERVIEW

This program is designed to simulate a real-world technology company environment in which students work as cross-functional product teams. Over a period of six months, students will design, develop, deploy, and present a production-grade software system that integrates mobile applications, web applications, artificial intelligence orchestration, and quantum computing algorithms.

Each team will work on a real-world problem statement and deliver a complete, scalable, cloud-deployed system consisting of:

Android mobile application

iOS mobile application

Web and desktop application

Backend server and database

AI orchestration engine

Quantum algorithm module

DevOps and cloud deployment pipeline

The program combines software engineering, product design, research methodology, and emerging technologies such as quantum computing and AI-driven automation.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES

By the end of the program, students will be able to:

Design professional user interfaces and user experiences for mobile and web platforms.

Develop full-stack applications using modern frontend and backend technologies.

Build and integrate AI orchestration systems for intelligent decision-making.

Design and simulate quantum computing algorithms for real-world optimization or prediction problems.

Implement DevOps practices including CI/CD, containerization, and cloud deployment.

Work in structured engineering teams with defined roles and responsibilities.

Produce professional technical documentation and research-style reports.
